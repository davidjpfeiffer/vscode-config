# VSCode Config

#### A collection of user settings and keyboard shortcuts for Visual Studio Code

The goal of this project is to map all Visual Studio shortcuts to Visual Studio Code, and to improve the general workflow within the application with an emphasis on front end development. Feel free to make suggestions.

#### What should be added

* Popular user settings
* All shortcuts from Visual Studio
* Any keyboard shortcut or setting that significantly improves the development experience

#### How To Change These Settings

The <i>settings.json</i> and <i>keybbindings.json</i> files are located in <i>C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Code\User</i>.

You can manually edit these files yourself, or clone this repo directly into that directory using the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/davidjpfeiffer/vscode-config.git .
```

If you chose this method, you can easily keep your files in sync with this repository using the following:

```
git pull
```
